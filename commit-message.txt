Fix : error in index.php

After running the initilaisation sql files and changing the database.php to add my credentials its not working. setup.php ran successfully. I've added debugging tools to help identify the issue. Please run these diagnostic scripts to see what's happening:

1. **debug.php** - Checks PHP extensions, database connection, table existence, and class loading
2. **test_login.php** - Tests the authentication system specifically
3. **Enhanced database.php** - Added better error reporting and connection validation

Run `debug.php` first to see the system status, then `test_login.php` to test the authentication. This will help identify whether the issue is with database connection, missing tables, class loading, or the authentication logic itself.
