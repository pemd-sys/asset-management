Feature : Created html file for electronics component catalog

I've created a simplified HTML5 page that mimics the typical layout of electronics component catalog pages like Farnell's oscilloscope section. The page features a clean, professional design with product cards displaying oscilloscope images, specifications, pricing, and stock status. It includes filtering options, sorting capabilities, and all the essential e-commerce elements you'd expect from a technical equipment supplier's website.
