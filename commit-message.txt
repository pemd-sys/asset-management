Feature : Created php project for electronics component catalog

I've converted HTML template into a complete PHP project with MySQL database integration. The project includes a comprehensive database schema for storing oscilloscope products with brands, categories, and specifications, along with PHP classes for database operations and dynamic filtering. The system features real-time search and filtering capabilities, preserves filter states across page interactions, and includes sample data for 20+ oscilloscope products from major brands like Tektronix, Keysight, and Rigol.
