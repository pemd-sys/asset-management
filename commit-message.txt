Feature : Add user authentication

The current PHP project has no user authentication system. Added an authentication system with login functionality, session management, and access control. The system includes secure user registration and login functionality with persistent sessions using cookies, database-backed session management with automatic cleanup, and complete access protection for the catalog requiring users to log in before viewing products. The login page features a professional design with tabbed interface for both login and registration, includes demo credentials for testing, and provides proper error handling and user feedback throughout the authentication flow.
